# newfile
newfile is a program designed to simplify making files in a Command Prompt much easier. Just type 1 command and your file is made!
## Side Notes
* newfile is useless on Linux because it already has the "touch" command.
## How to install
An .exe file will come soon, but for now, just stick to the guide below.
